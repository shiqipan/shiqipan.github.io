Welcome to my website!

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Smith college majoring in Computer Sciencen and Mathematics. I am fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. [Joseph Oâ€™Rourke](http://www.science.smith.edu/~jorourke/) and Prof. [Rajan Mehta](http://www.math.smith.edu/~rmehta/).

Research Interests
======
I am broadly interested in **algorithms design** in Computer Science Theory. In particular, I find **randomized algorithms** and **approximation algorithms** interesting. And I like exploring algorithmatic implementations in or intersection with fields such as computational geometry, combinatorics and game theory.
On the Mathematical side, I am broadly interested in **Combinatorics** and **Real Analysis**.

Personal Life
======
Beside academics, I also enjoy a few other things. I am a dancer and intrustor in [Smith K-pop Dance Crew](https://www.instagram.com/smikpop/). I am also part of the Chinese Student Association at Smith. My recent passion is fashion and eating order awareness advocating. See Others for more details.
