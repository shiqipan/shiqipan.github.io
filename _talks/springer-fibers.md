This is a research project with [Prof. Julianna Tymoczko](http://www.math.smith.edu/~jtymoczko/)'s research group on Springer Fibers and Webs. It aims to define the set of reduced webs in sl4 and a bijection between them and 4-row standard Young tableux.

My main research contribution includes:
1. Investigated a shape-matching pattern during promotions on standard Young tableaux with nested Young tableaux.
2. Defined a bijection between 4-row standard Young tableaux and some webs in sl4, contributing to definition of ultimate definition of bijection between 4-row standard Young tableaux and irreducible webs in sl4.
