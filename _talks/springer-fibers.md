This is a research project with [Prof. Tymoczko](http://www.math.smith.edu/~jtymoczko/)'s research group on Springer Fibers and Webs. It aims to define the set of reduced webs in sl4 and a bijection between them and 4-row standard Young tableux.

My main research contribution includes:
1. Investigation of patterns in promotions on standard Young tableaux with nested Young tableaux. See [journal](http://shiqipan.github.io/files/Springer_Webs__Promotion_pattern_on_Young_Tableaux_with_sub_tableaux_on_its_left.pdf) for more details.
